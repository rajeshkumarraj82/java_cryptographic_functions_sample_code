# java_cryptographic_functions_sample_code
This repository has sample code and methods for java cryptographic functionalities. These files are for quick reference. Also, we can copy, paste and modify these methods in other projects wherever required.

We have sample code for the following,
- How to create a message hash using SHA 256
- How to encrypt and decrypt using a symmetric key (with AES)
- How to encrypt and decrypt using an asymmetric key (with RSA)
- How to create and validate digital signatures.
